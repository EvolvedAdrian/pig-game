> The Pig Game is a classic multiplayer dice game. The goal is to reach 100 points before your opponent.

### Project Mechanics:
* **Roll the Dice:** Players take turns rolling a dice.
* **Risk:** If a player rolls a **1**, they lose all current points accumulated during that turn, and the turn automatically passes to the other player.
* **Holding Points:** A player can choose to "Hold" at any time, adding his turn's current score to his global score.
* **Winning Condition:** The first player to reach a total of **100 points** is the winner.
